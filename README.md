# lambdafunctionProject
Project to understand Lambda functions using Node js

## Project Goals
1) Use AWS Cloud services to design a robust system that toggles an AWS EC2 INSTANCE ON AND OFF
2) Make use of AWS SDK for node.js scripting language to develop a lambda function
3) Implement an API GATEWAY to provide the middleware for Rest api request and response
4) Notify users that EC2 instance is on or off with SNS
5) Develop this infrastructure with Terraform
